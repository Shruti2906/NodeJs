// What is node js

/**
 we run js in browser, every browser has their own js engine which executes it.
 eg chrome has v8, mozilla firefox has spider monkey etc.
    v8 is the most popoular one.

    using node we run js code outside of browser.

    Developer of nodejs:= Ryan Dahl

        -he embedded V8 with c++.
       so now, 
            -you can run js outside of the browser.
            -js can talk to native machine because of c++
            -you can create web servers in js language.
            so the code gets executed by v8 which is embedded in c++.

        Thus, NodeJs is a runtime environment for Js.

open cmd prompt -> node
    //it will open node's interactive terminal
    // Now here we can run js code.
